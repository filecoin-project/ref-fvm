## Unreleased

- Added `testing` feature to have `Default` derive on `Message`. Extended this feature to `Address` and `Payload`. 

## 0.6.0 [2022-04-14]

BREAKING: Switch syscall struct alignment: https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-specs/issues/63

Actors built against this new version of fvm_shared will be incompatible with prior FVM versions,
and vice-versa.

- Added `Display` trait to `Type` for error printing. 
- Added _cfg = "testing"_ on `Default` trait for `Message` structure.

## 0.5.1  [2022-04-11]

Add the `USR_ASSERTION_FAILED` exit code.

## 0.5.0 [2022-04-11]

- Enforce maximum big-int size to match lotus.
- Make signature properties public.
- Major error type refactor.

The largest change here is a major error type refactor.

1. It's now a u32 with a set of pre-defined values instead of an enum.
2. The error codes have been reworked according to the FVM spec.

Both of these changes were made to better support user-defined actors.
