# Contributing

This document describes the process of contributing to the reference FVM implementation (this project).

## Issues

If you have a general FVM related question or idea, please either as on the [Filecoin Slack][chat], or open
a new discussion in [fvm-specs][discuss].

If you'd like to report a _bug_ or suggest an enhancement in the reference FVM implementation, please file [an issue][issue].

## Pull Requests

To make a change to the FVM.

1. When in doubt, open an [issue][] first to discuss the change.
2. Make your change.
3. Write a test for your change.
4. Update the crate's `CHANGELOG.md`. If you're making any breaking changes, prefix change with
   "BREAKING:".
5. Finally, open a PR.

## Terminology
### Primary Crates
The primary crates are `fvm`, `fvm_shared`, `fvm_sdk`, and the integration testing framework `fvm_integration_tests`.  These are the crates that have [`version.workspace = true`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Afilecoin-project%2Fref-fvm%20version.workspace%20%3D%20true&type=code).

### Crate Dependency Graph

The crates in this workspace have the following structure:

## Testing
All changes should be well tested. 

### Builtin-Actors Testing

If you're releasing any non-trivial changes to crates used by the builtin actors, please test them. This includes:

- Any crates in `ipld/` except `car`.
- `shared/` (`fvm_shared`).
- `sdk/` (`fvm_sdk`).

To test:

1. Checkout this repo as `ref-fvm/` and the builtin-actors repo as `builtin-actors/` in the same directory.
2. Uncomment the "patch" section in `builtin-actors/Cargo.toml` that starts with:
    ```toml
    [patch.crates-io]
    fvm_shared = { path = "../ref-fvm/shared" }
    ...
    ```
3. Run `cargo test --all` (or, at a minimum, `cargo check --all --tests --lib`.

If that works, proceed with releasing these crates.

## Releasing

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for detailed release instructions.
