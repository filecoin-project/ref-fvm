//! This module contains the types and functions to process the init actor's state.
//! While it may appear leaky to deal with a concrete actor type in FVM-land,
//! truth is that certain syscalls can only be resolved by querying and manipulating
//! the init actor's state.
//!
//! In the future, we will revisit and redesign these components.
//!
//! This module can only deal with the Init Actor as of actors v3 ==
//! network version v10. The reason being that the HAMT layout changed.
