# Changelog

Changes to the reference FVM implementation.

## [Unreleased]

## 3.0.0-alpha.19 [2022-01-13]

- Adjust memory retention gas fees.
- Add a basic block-size limit of 1MiB.
- Update wasmtime to v2.0.2

## 3.0.0-alpha.18 [2022-01-10]

- Remove the CBOR trait
  - the `read_cbor` syscall is implemented over `DeserializeOwned`
- Executor: Always transform embryo to eth_account if executing message
- Rename embryo -> placeholder
- Kernel: remove support for non-key addresses from `verify_signature`
- Gas: Make the block "read" charge more accurate 
- StateTree: Rewrite snapshotting to have O(1) lookups
  - Maintain an undo history instead of true state "layers"
- Kernel: fix: return `NotFound` from `balance_of`
- feat: refactor memory limits and apply to tables
  - Refactors memory limits to remove the per-instance limits from the limiter itself
  - Removes wasmtime interfaces from the limiter, instead implementing a wrapper\
- Gas: Finalize write costs
- Gas: Remove the explicit extern cost

## 3.0.0-alpha.17 [2022-12-19]

- feat: split the state-tree's "read" and "write" caches
- fix: use correct sender state for account abstraction
- refactor: update the gas schedule:
  - Remove the old gas schedules.
  - Use ScalingCost everywhere to make things simpler.
  - Try to clearly split up operations in a way that should be easier to measure.
  - Rename the "storage gas" field on gas charges to "other gas", and move all charges that aren't charging for immediate computation. This makes benchmarking easier. Includes:
    - Deferred operations (e.g., flush).
    - Memory retention
    - Storage
  - Signature Validation:
    - Secp256k1 signature verification has gained a new 10gas/byte cost to reflect the cost of hashing (blake2b).
    - BLS signature verification has gained a new 26gas/byte cost to reflect the cost of hashing.
  - Hashing no longer has a flat cost (was 31355) but has the following costs (per algorithm):
    - sha256: 7gas/byte
    - blake2b: 10gas/byte
    - keccak256: 33gas/byte
    - ripemd160: 35gas/byte
  - Memory:
    - Memory copy costs have been reduced from 0.5gas/byte to 0.4gas/byte.
    - The "memory retention" cost of 10gas/byte has been split into a 2gas/byte memory _allocation_ cost, and an 8gas/byte memory retention cost.
  - Storage:
    - Block storage costs have increased by 13.8gas/byte (from 1300gas/byte to 1313.8gas/byte, or 1%):
      - PLUS 2 * 2 = 4 gas for an expected 2 allocations (one on write, one on flush).
      - PLUS 10gas/byte for hashing.
      - MINUS 0.1 * 2 gas/byte for the reduction in memcpy costs.
  - Randomness now charges for hashing:
    - 1400 for the "extern" call. 
    - 10gas/byte of entropy plus 480 gas for hashing the randomness itself.
- Explicit gas charges for different instruction types
- feat: charge 0.4gas/byte for memory copy and initialization

## 3.0.0-alpha.16 [2022-12-17]

- fix: remove duplicate "create_actor" method
- chore: remove "singleton" check
  - The singletons now generally assert that they've been created by the "system" actor.
- feat: only store delegated addresses in the state-tree
  - Restore the logic for resolving key addresses when verifying signatures.
  - Mass rename of predictable -> delegated.
  - No longer store f1/f3 in the delegated_address field of an ActorState.
- CallManager: Restrict embryo creation to the EAM's namespace
- feat: Gas: Reprice syscalls for which we have models

## 3.0.0-alpha.15 [2022-12-14]

- Refactor: Extract the `Engine` from the `Machine` and make it a pool
  - The `Engine` is replaced by an "Engine Pool", with `concurrency * call_depth` instances
  - The Engine Pool lives in the `Executor`
  - The `Engine` itself lives in the `CallManager`
- Update instrumentation logic
- Add charging logic for all memory copy and init operations
- Refactor: Move `ChainID` out of FVM (and into shared)
- Compile with `m2-native`
- Fix: Missing `Engine` getter 
- Feat: Gas timing stats and visualization
  - Adds gas timing tracing to conformance tests 
  - Adds a gas calibration contract to run specific instructions
- Feat: Implement Ethereum Account Abstraction
  - Remove the f4-as-account feature/hack entirely
  - The executor checks if sender is an embryo actor
  - If so, and the delegated address is in the f410 namespace, an Ethereum Account is deployed there

## 3.0.0-alpha.14 [2022-12-08]

- In send, change 0 gas to mean 0 gas (not unlimited).

## 3.0.0-alpha.13 [2022-12-07]

- FIX: Only push backtrace frames on _error_.
- Remove the gas limit from the context.
- Disable `memory_init_cow` in wasmtime. This will use a bit more memory, but will be predictable.
- Add the chain ID to the network context (defaults to 0).
- Add the nonce to the message context.

## 3.0.0-alpha.12 [2022-11-29]
- Fix: make sure exit never fails, even on an invalid message
- Limit the size of backtrace messages to 1k
- Add interior mutability to the gas tracker
- Refactor: Use ActorIDs for internal methods instead of Addresses
  - The caller now has to handle any resolution errors, and can choose how to do so
  - Avoid marking failures in some state-tree modification functions as "fatal errors".
- Add a read-only mode to Sends
  - Adds the concept of "read-only" layers to both the event accumulator and the state tree.
- Raise the maximum memory limit from 512MiB to 2GiB
- Fix: charge for the first page of gas
- Send syscall: add an optional gas limit
  -If specified, this limit will restrict the Send, not the message's remaining gas limit
- Charge gas for more syscalls
  - See [#1139](https://github.com/filecoin-project/ref-fvm/pull/1139) for the complete list

## 3.0.0-alpha.11 [2022-11-18]

- Replace `new_actor_address` with `next_actor_address`. `next_actor_address` has no side effects (until the actor is actually created).
- Change `next_actor_address` to always use the origin address from the message, as specified. For abstract accounts, we _can't_ lookup a key address (they may only have an f0 and f2 address).
- Move account creation logic to the call manager.
  - The call manager owns the relevant state.
  - The call manager will eventually invoke the constructor directly when creating the actor.
- Change the `abort` syscall to `exit` to allow:
  - non-local exits.
  - returning values on aborts.
- Add a method to the externs to lookup tipset CIDs.
- Remove the NetworkContext from the FVM builder API because we no longer expect the user to pass us a list of tipset CIDs.
- Change kernel internals to merge all network/message "context" methods into single methods returning `*Context` structs.
- Avoid treating out of memory instantiation errors as fatal.

## 3.0.0-alpha.10 [2022-11-17]

- Refactor network/message contexts to reduce the number of syscalls.

## 3.0.0-alpha.9 [2022-11-16]

- fix: BufferedBlockstore#flush should not reset the write buffer.

## 3.0.0-alpha.8 [2022-11-15]

- Add support for actor events (FIP-0049).

## 3.0.0-alpha.7 [2022-11-14]

- MEM-851: Memory expansion gas (#1067)
- Split `InvokeContext` into two (#1070)
- Support EAM singleton in manifest (#1005)

## 3.0.0-alpha.6

- update the state-tree version to v5
- enable instrumentation of sign extension instructions (only relevant to anyone playing around with native actor support).

## 3.0.0-alpha.5

- fix compile issues with f4-as-account feature.

## 3.0.0-alpha.4

- Resolve key addresses from the state tree instead of reaching into the account actor state
- Temporary workaround: allow validating signatures from embryo f4 addresses

## 3.0.0-alpha.3

- Fix the address length checks in the `create_actor` syscall. The previous release was broken.

## 3.0.0-alpha.2

- Autoload wasm modules from the blockstore if they haven't been preloaded.
- Add a new `balance_of` syscall.
- Add a new `tipset_cid` syscall.
- Add a new `timestamp` syscall.
- Add syscalls to get the gas limit, premium, and available gas.
- Add support for f4 addresses and auto-creating "embryos" on first send to an f4 address.
- Update wasmtime to 1.0.
- Add support for network version 18.

## 3.0.0-alpha.1

- Add the origin to the `vm::context` syscall.
- Add an `m2-native` feature to enable native actor deployment.

## 2.0.0...

See `release/v2`

- Added `recover_secp_public_key` syscall
- API BREAKING: Change `TokenAmount` type from a newtype to a struct.
- Add support for additional hash functions in actors:
    - sha256
    - keccak256
    - ripemd160
    - blake2b512
- API BREAKING: add gas charges to the execution trace.

## 1.1.0 [2022-06-27]

- debug execution: implement actor redirects in engine

## 1.0.0 [2022-06-23]

- Fixup WASM sections after instrumenting for gas and stack accounting. Without this,
  instrumentation would produce incorrect wasm modules in some cases.
- Fix exec tracing when stack depth is exceeded.
- Fix logging syscall to skip logging when debugging is _not_ enabled (the check was flipped).
- Audit and cleanup TODOs.
- Remove unused imports, etc.
- Refactor the blockstore "flush" to behave more like lotus.
- Upgrade wasmtime to 0.37.
- Fix the read syscall to correctly compute the returned "offset". Previously, it would never return
  a negative value, even if the passed-in buffer was over-sized.
- Make `DefaultExecutor#flush` a method on the `Executor` trait.
- Catch additional inner panics at the kernel layer, lowering them to syscall errors.
- General refinement of error handling by returning more fitting error numbers.
- General upstream dependency upgrade, including Wasmtime to 0.36.0.
- Reinstate the MAX_CID_LEN of 100 bytes.

## 0.8.0 [2022-05-16]

This release includes several major features:

- Final nv16 gas numbers (including charges for memcopies, extern calls, syscalls, etc.).
- Significantly improved wasm gas accounting, and stack accounting, through wasm instrumentation.
- A `ThreadedExecutor` for executing messages on a new thread. This is necessary because we need at
  least 64MiB of stack.
- Panics are now caught at every sub-call and turned into fatal errors.
- When a fatal error is encountered, we now allow the network to continue by:
  - Consuming all message gas.
  - Failing the entire _message_, but not the block.
- A large syscall refactor. These syscall interfaces should be the _final_ interfaces for M1.

**Breaking TL;DR:**

- This release DROPS SUPPORT for nv14.
- This release REQUIRES builtin-actors v7.4.x. v7.3.x _will not work_ due to breaking syscall changes.
- Users _must_ wrap the `DefaultExecutor` in a `ThreadedExecutor` unless they can otherwise
  guarantee at least 64MiB of stack.
- The execution trace format has changed.

Additionally, this release includes:

- Strongly typed a `Gas` type to help statically catch and prevent bugs in gas math.
- Refactored syscalls as described in the `fvm_sdk` v0.7.0 changelog.
- An audited and cleaned up wasmtime config.
- A smaller recursive call limit (now 1024 recursive sub-calls and 2k wasm stack elements).
- Drops support for NV14.
- Requires builtin-actors v7.4.x

## 0.7.2 [2022-05-09]
 
- Add `testing` feature to change module visibility; concretely changed
  visibility of `account_actor`, `init_actor` and `system_actor` to `pub`
  to use them in the integration test framework.
- Propagate gas outputs in ApplyRet.
- Migrate CBOR serde to [cbor4ii](https://github.com/quininer/cbor4ii).
- Instrument Wasm bytecode with [filecoin-project/fvm-wasm-instrument](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-wasm-instrument), 
  a fork of [paritytech/wasm-instrument](https://github.com/paritytech/wasm-instrument)
  for more accurate stack accounting and execution units metering.
- Abort when aborting fails.
- Fix syscall binding docs. 
- Fix bugs in Wasm execution units gas accounting.
- Fix system actor state serialization.
- Remove unused dependencies from build graph.
- Optimize memory resolution so it only happens once.

## 0.7.1 [2022-04-18]

This release adds support for execution traces in the FVM which can be enabled using the new `enable_tracing` option in the `MachineContext`.
The change is backwards compatible.

## 0.7.0 [2022-04-15]

This release contains exactly one (breaking) change.

BREAKING: Updates the FVM to the latest syscall struct alignment
(https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-specs/issues/63).

## 0.6.0 [2022-04-13]

- WIP NV16 support.
- Implement [FIP0032][]: NV16 will now charge gas for more operations, including execution gas.
- BREAKING: Updates to fvm_shared 0.5.1
    - This refactors the exit code into a struct with constant values instead of an enum.
- BREAKING: Refactor the `Machine` constructor to take a `MachineContext` struct, reducing the
  number of parameters.
- BREAKING: Rename (internal) consume/take methods.
     - `BufferedBlockstore::consume` -> `BufferedBlockstore::into_inner`
     - `Executor::consume` -> `Executor::into_machine`
     - `Kernel::take` -> `Kernel::into_call_manager`
     - `Machine::consume` -> `Machine::into_store`
     - `Hamt::consume` -> `Hamt::into_store`
     - `StateTree::consume` -> `StateTree::into_store`
- BREAKING: remove unused (by the FVM) `verify_post_discount` from the FVM PriceList.
