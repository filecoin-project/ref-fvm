// Q: Charge the first time? Or every time? We have several idempotent operations here.
// A: TODO

// Q: How to allocate?
// A: Let the user do it, and reference blocks with "handles".

// Q: Ids or CIDs in set/get root?
// A: CIDs.
//   - Forces the user to explicitly call "load" if they actually want the data.
//   - Gives the user access to the CID without forcing them to recompute it.
//   - Makes the user explicitly compute the CID.

// Q: We have open, do we have close?
// A: We'd need reference counting at runtime. Not terrible, but somewhat complicated. Do we need
//    it? We probably want it in the future, but maybe not yet.
//    Idea: Use WASM "reftypes". Maybe someday.

// Q: Do we really need `stat`?
// A: No, we don't. We can punt on that if we want to.
